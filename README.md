## What I learned

- Using React state,
- Creating React components using classes,
- Passing said state down multiple levels (i.e. App -> LeftSide -> CVForm -> one of the .js inside cvform folder there),
- Updating UI using state,
- Setting up basic React project,
- Passing props,
- Setting events with react,
- Getting started with React keys (which holds purpose for React to just know what changed and what not), with help from "uniqid" package,

## Features

- Editing some CV's fields in the preview with react state,
- Adding links, experience and school/certificates to state array,
- Removing said links from those sections by clicking on the "X" icon in the preview,
- Everything above is done without mutating the parent (App.js) state,

## To do
